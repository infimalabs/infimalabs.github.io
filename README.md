### Looking to gain an edge in the _real_ game?

***GRIT PAINTBALL*** is a Virtual Reality tournament paintball trainer and simulator. Aimed mostly at current paintball players
looking to gain an edge in the real game, GRIT allows players to practice from home. GRIT uses a mouse, keyboard and monitor for
the menu and field building parts of the game, and then you enter VR to experience the field you've designed.

#### GRIT can mix input from VR controllers and the Vive Tracker.

GRIT only requires one VR controller but will detect two, as it's designed so the player can replicate the feel of swapping their
gun from hand to hand. Custom hardware is being developed to allow players to utilize their own paintball gun with a Vive Tracker
so that players can get the most immersive and realistic feel possible. Of course, anyone can design their own hardware if they
have a Vive Tracker!

#### GRIT can edit layouts in-game and has up-to-date 2022 NXL bunkers.

Layouts can be locally saved and loaded, as well as easily shared between players by sending a small text file via email or
messenger. By utilizing VR, a player can gain an edge by being able to *walk* a field layout before a real life event and find
blind shots, bounce shots, lanes and other areas which could be missed when walking a real field before an event. It also allows
field owners and tournament operators to walk their field design to see whether adjustments need to be made before publishing a
layout for a real event. Targets are also included in the field editor, allowing players to practice muscle memory for breakouts,
snapshots and, with a large enough play area, moves from bunker to bunker.

## _What is infima.space?_

[Infima Space](https://infima.space){: target="_blank"} showcases research projects from [Infima Labs](/#infima-labs){:
.js-scroll-trigger}. Dedicated to the advancement of highly-interconnected virtual spaces, we believe the long-anticipated
arrival of mainstream spatial computing is near. We use this _space_ to aggregate and present our ideas and research on such
technologies.
