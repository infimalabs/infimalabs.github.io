### Looking to gain an edge in the real game?

***GRIT PAINTBALL*** is a Virtual Reality tournament paintball trainer and
simulator. Aimed mostly at current paintball players looking to gain an edge in
the real game, GRIT allows players to practice from home. GRIT uses a mouse,
keyboard and monitor for the menu and field building parts of the game, and
then you enter VR to experience the field you've designed.

##### Grit can mix input from VR controllers and the Vive Tracker.

GRIT only requires one VR controller but will detect two, as it's designed
so the player can replicate the feel of swapping their gun from hand to hand.
Custom hardware is being developed to allow players to utilize their own
paintball gun with a Vive Tracker so that players can get the most immersive
and realistic feel possible. Of course, anyone can design their own hardware if
they have a Vive Tracker!

##### GRIT can edit layouts in-game and has up-to-date 2022 NXL bunkers.

Layouts can be locally saved and loaded, as well as easily shared between
players by sending a small text file via email or messenger. By utilizing VR, a
player can gain an edge by being able to *walk* a field layout before a real
life event and find blind shots, bounce shots, lanes and other areas which
could be missed when walking a real field before an event. It also allows field
owners and tournament operators to walk their field design to see whether
adjustments need to be made before publishing a layout for a real event.
Targets are also included in the field editor, allowing players to practice
muscle memory for breakouts, snap shots and, with a large enough play area,
moves from bunker to bunker.
